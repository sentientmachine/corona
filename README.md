# A Replication and mirror of code and data from https://mackuba.eu/corona

People are dying to covid-19 right now and April 15 has seen another surge
in deaths per unit time.  When I saw Kuba Suder's masterful data science charts here:

I figured copyright can take a seat, we need more eyeballs per second on this
and evolving this sort of stuff.  Social distancing is less effective (not possible?) in more
population dense areas like New York and New Jersey.  Maybe because they're all in highrise
apartments and social distancing isn't possible?  These charts show where self-quarantining, 
is working and where they aren't working.

This repo has a snapshot and replica of the code that makes the web site, as I've pieced 
together from Chrome's developer tools.
